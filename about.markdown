My passion for the web began when my first HTML elements were rendered on the screen. From that day forward I committed myself to learning as much as I could about front-end and server-side development, making myself a technically proficient full-stack web developer. The mental challenges, my curiosity and the wondrous sense of accomplishment when a challenging piece of code functions exactly as expected keep me hooked and are incredibly rewarding. I thoroughly enjoy working collaboratively through the design and development process.

I have worked in-house and as an independent contractor specializing in front-end and back-end development including extensive experience with databases, APIs, PHP and PHP frameworks such as Laravel. My skillset is applicable to many of the modern web and software design and development challenges and I continuously keep myself up-to-date on emerging technologies through online subscriptions and documentation. I have a strong background and proven success in leading development from design through to front-end and server-side execution.
