<p>2019 really had it’s ups-and-downs. It sure tested me as a living being. It was a wild year and it made me think what is REALLY important in my life; everything ranging from my own development career to friends and family. That being said, I’m glad the year is behind me and can’t wait to start 2020 with a fresh state-of-mind.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-mental-health">A Note on Mental Health</h2>
<p>I hate talking about my mental health. So this is getting talked about first. Depression and anxiety is awkward to talk about for me. I feel like I’m just complaining when I talk to about it. I’m realizing that working long hours consistently for the past 2 years have been detrimental to my well-being. I’m making it a point this year to see a therapist regularly. Sometimes you need an hour session to talk to someone who would put you in a right frame of mind.</p>

<p>I have had my days where I’ve wanted to drive off of the road. It scares me, especially when I realize the impact and what is important. Though, I feel like this happening more often which is more than concerning. This past year’s struggles have definitely caused the frequency of these thoughts.</p>

<p>However, I’m realizing that I’m not alone in the game of life. I just need to talk, take fewer side projects, be more active, etc. Everybody has good and bad days. Even some weird years. I’m also worth more than I realize. To family, friends, colleagues and even acquaintances.</p>

<p>I’m not the smartest person in the world, but I’m more intelligent than the average bear. I have skills that I’ve invested over 10 years. Even through the toughest of times, I realize the I have the best, loving wife I could ever ask for, the best family in the world (even though both sides can be dysfunctional), and the best friends. I have more support than I realize and they help me grow everyday.</p>

<p>Also, meditation. I’m getting better at meditating longer. I just need to be consistent with my sessions. I think finding a good book in this category is in order.</p>

<p>It feel weird to get this out publicly, but I’m hoping this category of the post helps someone and myself. Mental health should be talked about.</p>

<h2 id="life-work-and-profession">Life, work and profession</h2>

<p>With the mental health reflection out of the way, let’s get into the good stuff.</p>

<p>I’m a goal-oriented person and I have a lot of them. Even though I’d like to achieve them all this year, it doesn’t mean I have to get to them all. Mental and physical well-being is more important. Can’t be a great, productive developer if I’m broken. Need to be more forward if I need a break and actually notice when I need one.</p>

<p>I need to also realize why I’m working. I’m working towards my goal of being financially independent while working on projects that I’m passionate about. I don’t want to be burnt out when I’m older, I want to be able to do things without worrying about money. I’m not materialistic and I hate the concept of money. I don’t want to be rich, but I don’t want to worry about money since the world is driven by it.</p>

<p>This year, I want to take a stab at bootstrapping a small product. I like the minimalism concept and I want to build products for people who need that service. It will keep my entrepreneurial and programming mind happy, while passionately providing support to a group of customers. I have a few ideas for a Saas application, but I’m still trying to work through ideas.</p>

<p>Moving on, I want to convince my current company to be open for me to work remote more often. I am way more productive that way, I can organize my goals better, I’m independently driven and don’t need someone looking over my shoulder, and I won’t drive myself insane commuting three hours a day.</p>

<p>If I can’t achieve the above, then I need to do some soul searching and evaluate if I want to stay with my current employer. Perhaps find a company that’s pro-remote and is used to having a remote team.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I really love the company I work for. I love the colleagues that I work with. I think I’m a good fit there and I like the way things are going currently. However, that’s not a reason to sacrifice my health, my goals, etc. Maybe this the year where I take the next step grow beyond where I’m at currently.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I should focus on spending more time with family, wife and friends. I’ve been isolating myself on my computer and I need focus on good times when I’m not working. I also need to learn when to stop working.</p>

<p>Here are my goals in list form:</p>

<h2 id="let-us-start-with-my-technical-goals">Let us start with my technical goals.</h2>
<p>These have been my goals for awhile, but listing them so I stick to them.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Use Go as a hobby language, but don’t be afraid to use for projects.</li>
  <li>Be more open to using React. Master Vue.</li>
  <li>Be more active in open source.</li>

  <li>Always be learning.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="closing-points">Closing Points</h2>
<p>This post has been on my mind for the past couple of months. I’ve been thinking about life and goals a lot. I feel like this post was needed for the blog. It’s always to take a step back from work and to evaluate the path I am taking. Good to audit it frequently. Anyway, I hope everyone had a good new year and I wish everyone a better, healthy year.</p>
