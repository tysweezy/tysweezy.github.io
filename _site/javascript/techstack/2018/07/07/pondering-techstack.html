<p>For about eight months or so, I decided to commit myself and focus on Node.js as my main backend techstack of choice. PHP/Laravel have treated me well and I’ve been loving Go, but I wanted to focus on one tech stack, which is now Node as my main go-to. There’s just something about Javascript that I can’t get away from. Maybe it’s the new features coming out, it’s functional programming nature and it’s flexibility. Who knows.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>I’ve been pretty happy with my choice to stick to Node as my primary stack. I mainly try to stick to Postgres as my database, express as my web framework of choice, etc. I tend to take the Go philosophy with me when I start a new project. I start very basic and small depending on my needs, then I work my way up as I go along. I find Node/Express to be very nice for this.</p>

<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-typescript">Some Thoughts on TypeScript</h2>

<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. You can think of it as “JavaScript with types.” I’ve been using for a current project that I’m working on and it has been a joy to work with. You can transfer your existing Node application from JS to TypeScript by just changing to file extension from “.js” to “.ts.” (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html">Check out migrating from JavaScript</a>) You can refactor as you need to and organize your application’s architecture as it grows.</p>

<p>For the database end-of-things, I’ve been using an ORM called <a href="http://typeorm.io/">Typeorm</a>. It seems to be quite new, however, a really solid ORM. It’s very similar to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/db/">Django’s ORM</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> and Laravel’s Eloquent. In fact, it does support both the Active Record pattern and the Data Mapper pattern. Really neat since I haven’t found an ORM I’ve liked when developing in Node.</p>

<h2 id="and-then-theres-python-and-django">And Then There’s Python and Django</h2>

<p>I really love Python! I really do! It was my first language that I’ve fully dove into and understood. <a href="https://www.bixly.com/">The dev shop I currently work at</a> primarily specializes in Django development and I’ve used it quite a bit over here. I love it (Did I mention that?)! As far as Django, I love using it for rapid prototyping and the Django Rest Framework is really solid. Since I’m a REST API development junky, it’s one of my favorite tools. I do want to make reusable Python/Django open source packages in the near future, just depends on needs and use-cases around a particular problem. I think I’ll keep coming back to Python as one of my main languages, and that’s just fine. :)</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>It’s kind of hard to decide which tech stack I want to choose as my main. Maybe it’s better to master both? Perhaps focus on mastering backend development instead of a particular stack? Perhaps switching between Node and Python is a good thing while playing around with Go on the side! Though which technologies I invest my time in has been on my mind a lot lately. What are your thoughts?</p>
