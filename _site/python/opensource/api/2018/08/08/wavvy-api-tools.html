<p>I’ve decided to start an open source project and fill another repository on my GitHub. Since I’ve been working more on the backend side and building services/REST APIs, I’ve had an urge to dedicate myself in this area. I thought it would a wonderful area to provide tooling for REST API development in Python.</p>

<h1 id="the-concept">The Concept</h1>

<p>I thought be interesting to create a framework agnostic library that provides helper methods/classes for handling data, particularly handling Python dictionary data and encoding/decoding JSON data in an elegant way.</p>

<p>At the base level, I wanted the library to have two classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transform  –&gt; a helper for formatting a json schema(s).</li>
  <li>Collection –&gt; a helper for handling python dictionary collections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps I can combine these into one class and handle a dictionary collection and json schema format.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-idea">Implementation Idea</h3>

<p>Here’s a basic example of how I would like this libary to work:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">wavvy.transformer</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Transform</span>

<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">some_dict</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s">'name'</span> <span class="n">some_dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'name'</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="s">'key'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">some_dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'key'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="s">'links'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s">'google'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'https://google.com'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">'twitter'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'https://twitter.com'</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A really basic example. Maybe the API could be named better. The Transform class could be named TransformJSON. Or! The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Transform</code> class could have methods that handle different types of schema types, such as XML.</p>

<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>

<p>For fun and learing mainly. Plus it would be nice to use tools that I’ve personally built in the wild. Also, I find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">json.loads()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">json.dumps()</code> methods in Python’s default <code class="highlighter-rouge">json</code> module to be named oddly, and it would be nice to have some syntactic sugar/wrappers around them.</p>

<h1 id="closing-points">Closing Points</h1>

<p>Wanted to write about this project as a start it and will provide updates as I go along. I’m thinking of writing a post about this project when a milestone is reached or an idea has come up. You can follow the project on <a href="https://github.com/tysweezy/wavvy">Github</a></p>
